# Estelle Tessaro - An autobiography
I was born in a small town in Belgium on April 2nd 1999, to a Belgian mother and an Italian father. As the oldest of four siblings in a loud family, I learned to become independent really quickly. I have two sisters and one brother:
*Chloe - 19 years old
*Matteo - 17 years old
*Julia - 9 years old
This early independence is one of the things that later led me to want to study abroad. I obtained my Bachelor's degree last June at *ESADE university* in Barcelona. It is through the internships I did during this degree that I discovered my interest in data analytics and visualisation. If you're interested, you can have a look at my past work experiences at <https://www.linkedin.com/in/estelletessaro/>. 
I moved back to Brussels in March 2020 after European countries began to lock down. While moving back was fun in the beginning (I loved spending more time with my siblings and parents), I quickly started to miss Barcelona and the life I had built there. The best thing that came out of our lockdown was Charlie, a border collie puppy we got at the beginning of 2021. They are incredibly cute and friendly black and white dogs, as pictured here.

However, as lockdown is ending and countries are reopening, I am excited to start a new chapter at London Business School!

# Task 2: `gapminder` country comparison

I was not able to complete this task as i had trouble plotting my data. I kept getting the same error message: Error: Aesthetics must be either length 1 or the same as the data (1704): colour

# Task 3: Brexit vote analysis

The last scatterplot we created shows a great correlation between people who were born in the UK, and voted to leave the European Union. There are several common explanations for this phenomenon. As mentionned above, one explanation could be a fear of immigration, and thus an aversion to the EU's border policy. Looking into the data more deeply, it is obvious that the regions with the highest counts of leave votes were in rural areas, where immigrant communities are limited, compared to the larger cities. It would make sense that a lack of these communities would foster a "fear of the unknown".

# Task 4: Animal rescue incidents attended by the London Fire Brigade

Which of these four graphs do you think best communicates the variability of the `incident_notional_cost` values? Also, can you please tell some sort of story (which animals are more expensive to rescue than others, the spread of values) and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

From the plots we have created, it seem that animals such as cows, ferrets, and rabbits have a great variability in notional costs. However, more commonly rescued animals such as cats and birds have similar respective notional costs, for the most part. This could be attributed to the fact that the latter are rescued more often, and thus have very generalized rescue procedures, whereas cows and rabbits are rescured more rarely, and thus are treated on a case basis (which can increase the cost quickly). I would say that the cow, ferret, rabbit and snake plots best communicate the variability of the incident_notional_cost values.

# Submit the assignment

Knit the completed R Markdown file as an HTML document (use the "Knit" button at the top of the script editor window) and upload it to Canvas.

## Details

If you want to, please answer the following

-   Who did you collaborate with: I did the assignment on my own
-   Approximately how much time did you spend on this problem set: 2.5 hours
-   What, if anything, gave you the most trouble: the second task (gapminder) gave me the most trouble, specifically when asked to produce a plot for the continent. I kept getting the same error message and could not figure out how to solve it. After spending an hour on this one plot, I moved on to the next task.
