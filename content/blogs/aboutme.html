<p>Hi! I’m Estelle!</p>
<p>Like I mentionned on the previous page, I love sunsets!</p>
<p>I also love other things though. First of all, I love to hang out with my friends and loved ones.</p>
<p><img src="/img/aboutme2.jpg" width="60%" /></p>
<p>I enjoy going to a bar with them and have a tapas and a beer in the sun, which brings me to my next point. I loooove food. Cooking food, eating food, smelling food, I love it all!</p>
<p>I can’t wait to discover London and it’s food scene now that I’m here to complete my Master in Analytics and Management at London Business School. And I also heard dinners with Kostis are legendary!</p>
<p>Before London, I lived in Barcelona for four years, where I completed my undergraduate Business degree at ESADE Business School. While I absolutely loved my time there (and miss the BCN sun), I’m so excited to be put outside of my comfort zone again in this new city.</p>
<p>Having lived in Brussels my whole life and coming from a Belgian-Italian family, I’ve come to love discovering new cultures and languages. Hoping London will be everything I expect it to be!</p>
<p>If you’re still reading this page, thanks, and have fun discovering the rest of my website!</p>
