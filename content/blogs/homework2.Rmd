If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies, we need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

```{r weather_data, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

```{r tidyweather}
#Let's turn the table from a wide into a long format
tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  select(-c("J-D","D-N","DJF","MAM","JJA","SON")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(2:13,
               names_to = "Month",
               values_to = "delta")
```

We inspect our dataframe. It has three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 

```{r scatter_plot}
#Let's create a new dataframe where we clean the dates in our data
tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

#Now, we can create a scatterplot for our data.
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

We use facet_wrap to see the weather anomalies by month of the year. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}
tidyweather$Month = factor(tidyweather$Month, levels=c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul",
                                                       "Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"))

#Let's now plot the weather anomalies
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~Month) +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )
```

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. 

```{r intervals}
#We tidy our data further to keep only what we need.
comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. 

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}
#Let's create a plot for the monthly deviations.
ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE))

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## 1.2. Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 
> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

We construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. 

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  # choose the interval 2011-present
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  filter(year >= 2011) %>%
  
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
            SD_delta = sd(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
            count_delta = n()) %>% 
  mutate(SE_delta = SD_delta/sqrt(count_delta),
         lower_CI = mean_delta-2*SE_delta,
         upper_CI = mean_delta+2*SE_delta)

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
set.seed(1234)

boot_weather <- comparison %>%
  # Choose only  Animation films
  filter(year >= 2011) %>%
  
  # Specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = delta) %>%
  
  # Generate a bunch of bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  
  # Find the median of each sample
  calculate(stat = "mean")

percentile_ci <- boot_weather %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_ci
```

The data shows us that from 2011 till present, the mean variation from expected temperature is positive 1.06 degree, the standard deviation is 0.276 and there are a total of 132 observations. With bootstrap, we generate a thousand sample means, each calculated with 132 observations extracted with replacement from our dataset, and get a new distribution representing the distribution of the population mean. With 95% confidence, we can say that the true population mean lays in the interval [1.01, 1.11].
