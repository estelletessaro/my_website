As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 


glimpse(approval_polllist) 

library(lubridate) 

clean_approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(enddate=mdy(enddate),
         week=isoweek(enddate)) 

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

We calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. We will plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. 

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "biden_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
clean_approval_polllist <- clean_approval_polllist %>%
  filter(subgroup == "Adults") %>%
  mutate(daily_approval_margin = approve - disapprove)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
weekly_avg_app_rates <- clean_approval_polllist %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarize( mean_weekly_approval_margin = mean(daily_approval_margin, na.rm = TRUE),
             number_polls = n(),
             std_weekly_approval_margin = STDEV(daily_approval_margin)) %>%

  mutate(lower_bound_CI_app_rate = mean_weekly_approval_margin - qt(0.975, df=number_polls-1)*std_weekly_approval_margin/sqrt(number_polls),
         upper_bound_CI_app_rate = mean_weekly_approval_margin + qt(0.975, df=number_polls-1)*std_weekly_approval_margin/sqrt(number_polls))
         
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(weekly_avg_app_rates, aes(x=week)) +
  geom_point(aes(y=mean_weekly_approval_margin, color="orangered")) +
  geom_line( aes(y=mean_weekly_approval_margin, color="orangered")) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_bound_CI_app_rate, 
                 ymax = upper_bound_CI_app_rate), 
                 show.legend = NA,
                 fill = "grey",
                 colour = "orange", 
                 alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y= mean_weekly_approval_margin), fill=NA)+
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, color="orange", size=3)+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Estimating Approval Margin (Approve - Disapprove) for Joe Biden",
    subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls",
    x = "Week of the year",
    y = "Average Approval Margin (Approve - Disapprove)"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Let's compare the confidence intervals of week 3 and week 25. The data has since been updated, but in the original plot, we can see that the 95% confidence intervals of week 3 are very far apart, compared to week 25. We can thus say that the mean of week 3 polls is going to be 95% statistically significant in a much wider range than the week 25 polls.
