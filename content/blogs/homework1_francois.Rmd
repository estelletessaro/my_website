# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)


# or download directly
alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```


What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about? 

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
alcohol_direct %>% 
  glimpse() %>%
  skim()

```


Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
top_countries_beer_servings <- alcohol_direct %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  arrange(-beer_servings) %>%
  head(25)

beer_plot <- ggplot(top_countries_beer_servings, aes(x= beer_servings, y= fct_reorder(country, beer_servings))) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 countries by beer servings",
    subtitle = "",
    x = "Beer Servings consumed per capita",
    y = NULL
  ) +
  NULL

beer_plot

```

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}
top_countries_wine_servings <- alcohol_direct %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  arrange(-wine_servings) %>%
  head(25)

wine_plot <- ggplot(top_countries_wine_servings, aes(x= wine_servings, y= fct_reorder(country, wine_servings))) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 countries by wine servings",
    subtitle = "",
    x = "wine Servings consumed per capita",
    y = NULL
  ) +
  NULL

wine_plot

```

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries

```{r spirit_plot}
top_countries_spirit_servings <- alcohol_direct %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  arrange(-spirit_servings) %>%
  head(25)

spirit_plot <- ggplot(top_countries_spirit_servings, 
                      aes(x= spirit_servings, y= fct_reorder(country, spirit_servings))) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 countries by spirit servings",
    subtitle = "",
    x = "spirit Servings consumed per capita",
    y = NULL
  ) +
  NULL

spirit_plot

```

```{r plot_for_comparision}
beer_plot <- beer_plot + geom_col(fill = "red")
wine_plot <- wine_plot + geom_col(fill = "green")
spirit_plot <- spirit_plot + geom_col(fill = "blue")

ggarrange(beer_plot, wine_plot, spirit_plot,
                    ncol = 3, nrow = 1)
```


What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

First we can infer that European countries tend to consume more wine and beer than spirits.
It is surprising to see that Germany is only number 4 in the beer consumer ranking behind Gabon, Namibia...

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

  
```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

- `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
- `budget`: The movie's budget 
- `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
- `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB 
- `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
- `rating`: IMDB average rating 

## Use your data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to answer the following:

```{r}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
movies %>% 
  glimpse() %>%
  skim()
```

```{r}
distinct(select(movies, title, year, genre, director))
```

```{r}
movies[duplicated(movies$title),] %>% arrange(title)
```

- Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?

> No missing values but 52 duplicates and 1 triplet

- Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order


```{r}
movies_genre <- movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarise(count = count(genre)) %>%
  arrange(-count)
movies_genre
```

- Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many $ did a movie make at the box office for each $ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order

```{r}

movies <- movies %>%
  mutate(
    return_on_budget = gross/budget
  )

movies_means <- movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarise(average_return_on_budget = mean(return_on_budget)) %>%
  arrange(-average_return_on_budget)
movies_means

```


- Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.


```{r}
movies %>%
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise(
    director = director,
    revenue = gross,
    mean_revenue = mean(revenue),
    median_revenue = median(revenue),
    std_revenue = StdDev(revenue)
  ) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = revenue, n=15)
```

- Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don't want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed. 

```{r}
movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  select(rating, genre) %>%
  skim()
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  labs(title="") +
  xlim(0,10) +
  facet_wrap(~genre, scales = "free") +
  NULL

```


## Use `ggplot` to answer the following

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether the number of facebook likes that the cast has received is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. What variable are you going to map to the Y- and X- axes?
  
  
```{r, gross_on_fblikes}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=cast_facebook_likes, y=gross)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", formula=y~x) +
  labs(title="Cast facebook likes to Gross Revenue", x="Cast Facebook Likes", y="Gross Revenue") +
  NULL
```

> The graph tells us that cast facebook likes is not a good predictor of gross revenue, the two variables only has a correlation coefficient of 0.213.

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.

```{r, gross_on_budget}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=budget, y=gross)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", formula=y~x) +
  labs(title="Budget to Gross Revenue", x="Budget", y="Gross Revenue") +
  NULL
```
  
> The graphs shows a strong relationship between the gross and the budget, and the two variables have a high correlation coefficient of 0.641 and hence we say that budget is a good predictor of gross.
  
  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. Produce a scatterplot, faceted by `genre` and discuss whether IMDB ratings are likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. Is there anything strange in this dataset?

```{r, gross_on_rating, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating, y=gross)) +
  geom_point(size=0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", formula=y~x) +
  labs(title="Ratings to Gross Revenue", x="Ratings", y="Gross Revenue") +
  facet_wrap(~genre) +
  NULL
```

> When we compare ratings to gross revenue, we can see that the rating variable is really genre specific. For example, in Action and Advantage, we can say that rating are a good predictor for gross revenue. However, for other genres, either there is no correlation or we do not have enough data points to infer a relationship.

# Returns of financial stocks


> You may find useful the material on [finance data sources](https://mam2022.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/). 

We will use the `tidyquant` package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns. 

We must first identify which stocks we want to download data for, and for this we must know their ticker symbol; Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald's as MCD, etc. The file `nyse.csv` contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker `symbol`, `name`, the IPO  (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.


```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
```

Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
nyse %>%
  group_by(sector) %>%
  summarise(sector_count = count(sector)) %>%
  arrange(desc(sector_count)) %>%
  kable()

nyse %>%
  group_by(sector) %>%
  summarise(sector_count = count(sector)) %>%
  arrange(desc(sector_count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=sector_count, y=fct_reorder(sector,sector_count))) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title="Number of companies per sector", x="Count", y="Sector") +
  NULL
```

Next, let's choose some stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. You **MUST** choose 6 different stocks from the ones listed below; You should, however, add `SPY` which is the SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).


```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument in the chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, 
# cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- c("AAPL","JPM","DIS","DPZ","TSLA","XOM","SPY" ) %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2011-01-01",
         to   = "2021-08-31") %>%
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.


```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

Create a table where you summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
myStocks_returns_monthly %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  select(symbol, monthly_returns) %>%
  skim()
```


Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks
```{r density_monthly_returns}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
ggplot(myStocks_returns_monthly, aes(x=monthly_returns)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~symbol) +
  labs(title="Density plot for monthly return of stocks", x="Monthly Returns", y="Density") +
  NULL
```

What can you infer from this plot? Which stock is the riskiest? The least risky? 

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

From the graph, we can infer that almost all density plots are centered around zero. The index fund (SPY) exhibits the least amount of variation in returns as expected. Similarly, well-established firms such as JPM and XOM has similar distributions to the index fund, in comparison, newer companies like TSLA exhibits more variation in returns.


Finally, make a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock

```{r risk_return_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
myStocks_returns_monthly %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  summarise(ret_mean = mean(monthly_returns),
            ret_sd = sd(monthly_returns)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ret_sd, y=ret_mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = symbol)) +
  labs(title="Stocks return's risk to mean", x="Risk of Stock", y="Mean monthly returns") +
  NULL
```

What can you infer from this plot? Are there any stocks which, while being riskier, do not have a higher expected return?

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

We can infer from the plot that TSLA is the riskiest stock but at the same time also offers the highest expected monthly return. The index fund (SPY) while having the lowest risk but still offers a similar return to JPM. XOM is offering a really low expected monthly return compared to the amount of risk that it offers.

# On your own: IBM HR Analytics


For this task, you will analyse a data set on Human Resoruce Analytics. The [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance data set](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.  Among other things, the data set includes employees' income, their distance from work, their position in the company, their level of education, etc. A full description can be found on the website.


First let us load the data

```{r}

hr_dataset <- read_csv(here::here("data", "datasets_1067_1925_WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv"))
glimpse(hr_dataset)

```

I am going to clean the data set, as variable names are in capital letters, some variables are not really necessary, and some variables, e.g., `education` are given as a number rather than a more useful description


```{r}

hr_cleaned <- hr_dataset %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    education = case_when(
      education == 1 ~ "Below College",
      education == 2 ~ "College",
      education == 3 ~ "Bachelor",
      education == 4 ~ "Master",
      education == 5 ~ "Doctor"
    ),
    environment_satisfaction = case_when(
      environment_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      environment_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      environment_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      environment_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    job_satisfaction = case_when(
      job_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      job_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      job_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      job_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    performance_rating = case_when(
      performance_rating == 1 ~ "Low",
      performance_rating == 2 ~ "Good",
      performance_rating == 3 ~ "Excellent",
      performance_rating == 4 ~ "Outstanding"
    ),
    work_life_balance = case_when(
      work_life_balance == 1 ~ "Bad",
      work_life_balance == 2 ~ "Good",
      work_life_balance == 3 ~ "Better",
      work_life_balance == 4 ~ "Best"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(age, attrition, daily_rate, department,
         distance_from_home, education,
         gender, job_role,environment_satisfaction,
         job_satisfaction, marital_status,
         monthly_income, num_companies_worked, percent_salary_hike,
         performance_rating, total_working_years,
         work_life_balance, years_at_company,
         years_since_last_promotion)

```

Produce a one-page summary describing this dataset. Here is a non-exhaustive list of questions:

1. Is there any relationship between monthly income and education? Monthly income and gender?

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=fct_reorder(education,monthly_income), y=monthly_income)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title="Box Plot showing the distribution of monthly income for each education level",
       x="Education Level",
       y="Monthly Income") +
  NULL

```

```{r}
hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarise(education_count = count(education))
```

> From the graph above, we can see that the average monthly income is ranked by from highest to lowest: Doctor, Master, College, Bachelor, Below College. It is unusual that the average monthly income of Bachelor graduates are lowest than that of College graduates. This might be because of the higher number of Bachelor graduates of 572 compared to only 282 College graduates, this means people with exceptionally high income can impact the average values of College than Bachelor.

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=monthly_income, color=gender)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title="Density plot for monthly income of different gender",
       x="Monthly Income",
       y="Density") +
  NULL

```

> We can see that Female has a higher mode for monthly income compared to that of man. Other than that, in general, the income distribution for the two gender looks very similar.

1. Plot a boxplot of income vs job role. Make sure the highest-paid job roles appear first

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=monthly_income, y=fct_reorder(job_role, monthly_income))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title="Box plot showing monthly income for different roles",
       x="Monthly Income",
       y="Job Role") +
  NULL

```

> From the plot, we can see that Manager and Research Director are the highest paying roles and leads by a very large amount. Even the highest income individuals from the other roles does not reach the average income these two roles.

1. Plot income vs age, faceted by `job_role`

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=age, y=monthly_income)) +
  geom_point(size=0.9) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", formula=y~x) +
  facet_wrap(~job_role) +
  labs(title="Scatter plot showing relationship between monthly income and age",
       x="Age",
       y="Monthly Income") +
  NULL
```

> For different job roles, we can see that age affects monthly income in different degrees. For example, for Sales Representative and Laboratory Technician, the monthly income is less affected by experience, it should be noted that people can change position throughout their career and are unlikely to stay in the same position forever. 

1. So lets have a look at the relationship between monthly income and the number of companies worked in.

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=num_companies_worked, y=monthly_income, group=num_companies_worked)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title="Box Plot showing relationship between monthly income and number of companies worked in",
       x="Number of companies worked in",
       y="Monthly Income") +
  NULL

# cor(hr_cleaned$num_companies_worked, hr_cleaned$monthly_income)
```

> We can observe from the graph that the number of companies worked in has little affect on the monthly income. The two variables only has a correlation 0.15.

1. What is the effect of total working experience on monthly income

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=total_working_years, y=monthly_income)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", formula=y~x) +
  labs(title="Total working years to Monthly income", 
       x="Number of total working years",
       y="Monthly Income") +
  NULL
```

> The graph shows a strong relationship between the number of total working years and monthly income.

# Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. Read the  article [The Racial Factor: There's 77 Counties Which Are Deep Blue But Also Low-Vaxx. Guess What They Have In Common?](https://acasignups.net/21/07/18/racial-factor-theres-77-counties-which-are-deep-blue-also-low-vaxx-guess-what-they-have) and have a look at the attached figure.

```{r challenge1, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "vaxxes_by_state_red_blue_every_county_070321_1.jpeg"), error = FALSE)
```


You dont have to worry about the blue-red backgound and don't worry about replicating it exactly, try and see how far you can get. You're encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out-- and even though the figure in the original article is from early July 2021, you can use the most recent data.

Some hints to get you started:

1. To get vaccination by county, we will use [data from the CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh) 
1. You need to get [County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
1. Finally, you also need an estimate of the [population of each county](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232)
 


```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# Download CDC vaccination by county
cdc_url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8xkx-amqh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
vaccinations <- vroom(cdc_url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(fips != "UNK") # remove counties that have an unknown (UNK) FIPS code

# Download County Presidential Election Returns
# https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ
election2020_results <- vroom(here::here("data", "countypres_2000-2020.csv")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # just keep the results for the 2020 election
  filter(year == "2020") %>% 
  
  # change original name county_fips to fips, to be consistent with the other two files
  rename (fips = county_fips)

# Download county population data
population_url <- "https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232"
population <- vroom(population_url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # select the latest data, namely 2019
  select(fips = fip_stxt, pop_estimate_2019) %>% 
  
  # pad FIPS codes with leading zeros, so they are always made up of 5 characters
  mutate(fips = stringi::stri_pad_left(fips, width=5, pad = "0"))

```

```{r}
election_data_trump <- election2020_results %>%
  filter(candidate == "DONALD J TRUMP") %>%
  group_by(fips) %>% 
  summarise(total_donald_votes = sum(candidatevotes))

election_data_total <- election2020_results %>%
  group_by(fips) %>%
  summarise(total_votes = sum(candidatevotes))

election_data_trump <- left_join(election_data_trump, election_data_total, by="fips") %>%
  mutate(donald_vote_rate = (total_donald_votes/total_votes)*100)

data <- vaccinations %>% 
  filter(date == "09/04/2021") %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  left_join(election_data_trump, by="fips") %>%

  na.omit()

# Challenge 2: Opinion polls for the 2021 German elections

The Guardian newspaper has an [election poll tracker for the upcoming German election](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor).
The list of the opinion polls since Jan 2021 can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election) and your task is to reproduce the graph similar to the one produced by the Guardian. 


The following code will scrape the wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.


```{r, scrape_wikipedia_polling_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election"
# https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/who-will-succeed-angela-merkel
# https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/21/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor


# get tables that exist on wikipedia page 
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
polls <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())


# list of opinion polls
german_election_polls <- polls[[1]] %>% # the first table on the page contains the list of all opinions polls
  slice(2:(n()-1)) %>%  # drop the first row, as it contains again the variable names and last row that contains 2017 results
  mutate(
         # polls are shown to run from-to, e.g. 9-13 Aug 2021. We keep the last date, 13 Aug here, as the poll date
         # and we extract it by picking the last 11 characters from that field
         end_date = str_sub(fieldwork_date, -11),
         
         # end_date is still a string, so we convert it into a date object using lubridate::dmy()
         end_date = dmy(end_date),
         
         # we also get the month and week number from the date, if we want to do analysis by month- week, etc.
         month = month(end_date),

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
