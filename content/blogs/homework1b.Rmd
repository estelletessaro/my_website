# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)


# or download directly
alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```


What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about? 

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
alcohol_direct %>% 
  glimpse() %>%
  skim()

```


Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
top_countries_beer_servings <- alcohol_direct %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  arrange(-beer_servings) %>%
  head(25)

beer_plot <- ggplot(top_countries_beer_servings, aes(x= beer_servings, y= fct_reorder(country, beer_servings))) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 countries by beer servings",
    subtitle = "",
    x = "Beer Servings consumed per capita",
    y = NULL
  ) +
  NULL

beer_plot

```

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}
top_countries_wine_servings <- alcohol_direct %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  arrange(-wine_servings) %>%
  head(25)

wine_plot <- ggplot(top_countries_wine_servings, aes(x= wine_servings, y= fct_reorder(country, wine_servings))) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 countries by wine servings",
    subtitle = "",
    x = "wine Servings consumed per capita",
    y = NULL
  ) +
  NULL

wine_plot

```

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries

```{r spirit_plot}
top_countries_spirit_servings <- alcohol_direct %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  arrange(-spirit_servings) %>%
  head(25)

spirit_plot <- ggplot(top_countries_spirit_servings, 
                      aes(x= spirit_servings, y= fct_reorder(country, spirit_servings))) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 countries by spirit servings",
    subtitle = "",
    x = "spirit Servings consumed per capita",
    y = NULL
  ) +
  NULL

spirit_plot

```

```{r plot_for_comparision}
beer_plot <- beer_plot + geom_col(fill = "red")
wine_plot <- wine_plot + geom_col(fill = "green")
spirit_plot <- spirit_plot + geom_col(fill = "blue")

ggarrange(beer_plot, wine_plot, spirit_plot,
                    ncol = 3, nrow = 1)
```


What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

First we can infer that European countries tend to consume more wine and beer than spirits.
It is surprising to see that Germany is only number 4 in the beer consumer ranking behind Gabon, Namibia...
